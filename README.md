This repository contains my learning journey of rust language. It hosts a set of resources to learn rust and each topic will have branch of its own which is going to build up on the previous branch.

## Resources

- [A half-hour to learn rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust)
- [Tour of rust](https://tourofrust.com/)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)
- [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Getting started with Rust

1. Install `rustup` - an installer for rust programming language.
   - It can be installed from [here](https://rustup.rs/)
   - In case compiling rust programs gives linker error you can install `C` compiler.
2. To verify installation run the following commands:
   - `rustc --version`
   - `cargo --version`

`rustc` is the rust compiler.
`cargo` is the Rust's package manager, just like `npm`.
