## Macros

- Macros are a way to write code which writes other code, this concept is called _metaprogramming_. We can think of them as function where the input is code and the output is also code.

- Functions must declare a set of parameters they can accept, whereas macros can accept variable number of parameters.

- Functions are called at runtime, macros are expanded before the code finishes compiling.
