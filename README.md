This repository contains my learning journey of rust language. It hosts a set of resources to learn rust and each topic will have branch of its own which is going to build up on the previous branch.

## Getting started with Rust

1. Install `rustup` - an installer for rust programming language.
   - It can be installed from [here](https://rustup.rs/)
   - In case compiling rust programs gives linker error you can install `C` compiler.
2. To verify installation run the following commands:
   - `rustc --version`
   - `cargo --version`

`rustc` is the rust compiler.
`cargo` is the Rust's package manager, just like `npm`.

3. Run the following command to create a new **package**.
   `cargo new hello_world`

The command above will create a new package called **hello_world**.
